HackerLand Enterprise is adopting a new viral advertising strategy. When they launch a new product, they advertise it to exactly 5 people on social media.

On the first day, half of those 5 people (i.e.,floor(5/2)=2 ) like the advertisement and each shares it with 3 of their friends. At the beginning of the second day,floor(5/2)*3=6  people receive the advertisement.

Each day,floor(recipients/2)  of the recipients like the advertisement and will share it with 3 friends on the following day. Assuming nobody receives the advertisement twice, determine how many people have liked the ad by the end of a given day, beginning with launch day as day 1.
