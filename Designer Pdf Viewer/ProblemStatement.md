When a contiguous block of text is selected in a PDF viewer, the selection is highlighted with a blue rectangle. In this PDF viewer, each word is highlighted independently.

There is a list of 26 character heights aligned by index to their letters. For example, 'a' is at index 0 and 'z' is at index 25. There will also be a string. Using the letter heights given, determine the area of the rectangle highlight in mm2 assuming all letters are  1mm wide.
